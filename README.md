# Regularization-and-Feature-Selection

Ames housing dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables, as well as a wide range of features and attributes connected to each property. In the Ames house Dataset, the regression model we created for predicting house prices has produced encouraging results. We chose the Gr.Liv.Area, Garage.Area, and Total.Bsmt.SF variables as significant predictors of the SalePrice after examining and evaluating the dataset. The multiple linear regression model produced a high R-squared value of 0.6795, indicating that the selected predictors can account for roughly 67.95% of the variance in home prices. All of the model's coefficients were statistically significant (p 0.001), indicating that they significantly affect house prices.
